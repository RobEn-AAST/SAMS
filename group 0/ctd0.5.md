# Challenges To Do
(**ctd** for short)

The highlight of this CTD is:
- get better at using the terminal
- use new libraries

If the code does not meet our standards, it would not be accepted and must be redone.

### RobFlix

create a youtube downloader utility that downloads videos and manages them.
The program can be terminal based or with a GUI, it should take the name of the video to download as input and search for it on youtube then download the first search result in a directory.
The program should have a feature that shows the user all downloaded videos.
